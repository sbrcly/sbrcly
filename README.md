### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Scott Barclay
#### I'm a web developer

Currently living in Las Vegas, NV but am
willing and happy to relocate if need be. You'll be hiring
someone with a passion for acquiring new skills, building
things from scratch, and who finds perfect Lighthouse
scores oddly satisfying. 

Skills: JavaScript / CSS / HTML

Currently working on: React / MongoDB / NodeJS
